# Guess What? I Shot Train Through a Building In 2014

Surprising fact: The train passing through a building only became an internet sensation in 2017, but I started filming short clips of it way back in 2014. At that time, I was still using an iPhone 4s, traveling around Chongqing, and spending a lot of time repeatedly shooting the scene. As a local from Chongqing, I also shared my videos with friends and foreigners I met during my travels abroad. However, most foreigners hadn't even heard of Chongqing back then.
