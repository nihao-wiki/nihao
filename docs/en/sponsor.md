## Become a Sponsor

Nihao is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

### How to Sponsor

Sponsorships can be done via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective. Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.
