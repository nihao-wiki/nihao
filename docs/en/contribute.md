## Contribute Code

### Bug Fixes

Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make. They are welcome at any time.

### New Features

For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the RFC repo.

### Translate Docs

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?

### Become a Categories Leader

We can't be experts on every aspect of travel or every region in China. If you're a professional in the field or a local expert, we warmly welcome you to join us.

## Become a Sponsor

Nihao is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

### How to Sponsor

Sponsorships can be done via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective. Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.

### Sponsoring Nihao as a Business

### Sponsoring Nihao as an Individual

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Nihao, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying us coffee once in a while.
