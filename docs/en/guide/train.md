## Meal On Train

### Dining Car

The train has a dining car that offers boxed meals, fast food, and snacks.

### Ordering Delivery

You might want to try ordering delivery while on the train.

Log in to the 12306 official website or use the 12306 App. On the order details page, there is usually an option to order meals. You need to select the station and meal you want to order from. The food will be brought onto the train at that station and delivered to your seat.

Please note that meal ordering is not available at all stations, and you need to place your order before the train arrives at the station. The choice of vendors is limited, but options such as McDonald's and KFC are included.

::: info LOCAL TIPS
You should plan your meal orders ahead of time. You can check the arrival times at each station in your order details and identify the stations that support ordering and are reached around your mealtime, then make your reservations in advance.
:::

## Booking Online

You can purchase train tickets with cash at the station, but it is more recommended to book them online using an app, which is more convenient.

::: info LOCAL TIPS
Chinese trains have a very high punctuality rate; it is recommended to arrive at the station 30 minutes before departure.
:::

::: info LOCAL TIPS
You can book tickets up to 15 days in advance. Tickets for holidays such as the Spring Festival and National Day are very tight, and it may not be possible to secure them even if you book 15 days ahead. Please try to avoid traveling during these periods if possible.
