Potential issues you may encounter during these holidays:
- **Heavy Crowding**: Popular tourist destinations, restaurants, shopping centers, and transportation hubs can become extremely crowded.
- **Booking Difficulties**: Difficulty in securing flights or train tickets, limited availability of attraction tickets, and fully booked hotels.
- **Traffic Control Measures**: Such as suspended bus services in densely populated areas, subway skip-stopping, and vehicle bans, which may require walking.
- **Price Fluctuations**: The prices for services such as air tickets, hotels, and dining may rise, and could even double.
- **Tourist Stranding**: In extreme cases, the closure of scenic areas and highway congestion can lead to tourists being stranded, making it impossible for them to leave promptly, and causing disruptions to their daily life and meals.
