# Guide to Mobile Payment in China

The most popular payment method nowadays is by scanning a code, with common options being Alipay and WeChat Pay; bank cards and credit cards are generally accepted in places like malls and restaurants. Of course, cash can also be used.

## Alipay

Alipay can conveniently bind bank cards and complete transactions for both receiving payments and making payments. It can also be used conveniently for various scenarios such as online shopping, metro transportation, mobile phone top-ups, and identity verification.

### Registration

Alipay already cooperates with 65 financial institutions, among which are Visa and Mastercard, so if you already have a credit card all you have to do is download the Alipay app on your cell phone and register in a few simple steps. However, note that some of the functions only work if you use a Chinese credit (or debit) card.

Once you finish downloading the application, open it and proceed to the registration: you’ll first be asked to enter your **cell phone number**, later you’ll receive a message with a numeric code that you’ll have to enter in the app to continue with your registration.

The Alipay home page will open, so now you will have to add your credit card: access your profile by clicking on **“Me”** and then click on **“Bank Cards”** and proceed with the compilation or requested information, such as credit card number and your name and last name. Later Alipay will ask you to also enter a password to allow you to make payments with this application.

### Scan & Pay

The application is very intuitive and the first useful buttons will be **“Scan”** and **“Pay”**. The “Scan” button is for scanning QR codes: when paying at some stores and restaurants they’ll ask you to scan their QR code on your phone to then enter the amount to pay along with your password to enable payment.

The “Pay” button, instead, will make a bar code appear on the display of your smartphone to show in restaurants and scanner-equipped stores for payment: it’s a little like at supermarkets, your bar code will be scanned and without even having to enter your password the money will be directly transferred from your account.

It’s incredible how everything happens with a simple “scan”, even at the market, here in China, they almost never use the dear old banknotes and the 1 CNY coins already seem like antique relics. But be careful because this method of payment can really cause you to lose track of the money you spend: each time I find it emotional to see that the payment went through without a problem!

This app has many other interesting uses, for example, the “Collect” button will open a new QR code to show people who owe you money. You can specify the amount that they owe you by clicking on “Specify an Amount” before having them scan your code or letting them enter the amount they have to pay you back.

## WeChat Pay

WeChat started as a social media app and, due to its large user base, has become widely used for its payment feature.
