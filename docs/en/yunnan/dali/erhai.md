There are numerous attractions around the lake, including islands that can be explored by boat and hills suitable for hiking. Additionally, Erhai serves as a habitat for many bird species, attracting birdwatchers.

## Dali Ancient City

The history of Dali Ancient City can be traced back to the Nanzhao Kingdom, which was established in the early 8th century. Dali became a significant political center during the rule of the Duan family under the Dali Kingdom (937 to 1253), when it reached its peak. The current incarnation of Dali Old Town began its construction during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, around 1382 AD. Thus, if counted from the Ming Dynasty reconstruction, Dali Old Town has a history of over 600 years.

## the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple

The Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple is a group of Buddhist structures includes the main Qianxun Pagoda and the smaller Northern and Southern Pagodas. The Qianxun Pagoda is the tallest among them, standing at 69.13 meters high, built between 833 and 840 AD during the Tang Dynasty. The smaller pagodas were constructed slightly later, probably in the late 9th to early 10th centuries.

Beyond being a landmark in the Dali region, the Three Pagodas hold significant status within Buddhist history. They symbolize the flourishing of Buddhism during the periods of the Nanzhao and Dali Kingdoms, serving as one of the centers for Buddhist activities in the area. The existence of the Three Pagodas reflects the profound influence of Buddhism on local social life and provides valuable references for studying Buddhist art and architectural styles of the era.
