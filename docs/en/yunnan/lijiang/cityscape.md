# Lijiang Ancient City Beside the Snow-Capped Mountains

## Lijiang Ancient City

The history of Dali Ancient City can be traced back to the Nanzhao Kingdom, which was established in the early 8th century. Dali became a significant political center during the rule of the Duan family under the Dali Kingdom (937 to 1253), when it reached its peak. The current incarnation of Dali Old Town began its construction during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, around 1382 AD. Thus, if counted from the Ming Dynasty reconstruction, Dali Old Town has a history of over 600 years.
