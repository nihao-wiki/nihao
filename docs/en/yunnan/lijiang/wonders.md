<template #description>I climb to the highest peak of my life, (4,680 metres / 15,354 feet above sea level). It's a pretty fast climb too (There may be a cable car involved). As you ascend so quickly you need oxygen canisters to help you avoid altitude sickness! </template>

## Meili Snow Mountain

Meili is not a single peak but a series of mountains with an average elevation of over 6,000 meters, collectively known as the "Thirteen Peaks of the Crown Prince." The main peak, **Kawagebo**, stands at 6,740 meters and is the highest peak in Yunnan Province, remaining unconquered to this day.

According to Tibetan legends, Kawagebo was once a source of malevolent power but was subdued by Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), transforming it into a guardian deity of Buddhism. These legends add to the mystique of Meili Snow Mountain and reinforce its status as a holy site in Tibetan Buddhism.
