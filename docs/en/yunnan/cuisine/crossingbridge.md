Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles is one of the traditional delicacies of Yunnan Province, particularly famous in the Kunming area. This dish has a long history, with legends tracing its origins back to the Qing Dynasty.

Traditionally, the preparation starts with making a clear and flavorful broth, typically by simmering chicken, bones, and other ingredients. When served, customers add raw meat slices (such as chicken, pork, or beef), vegetables, bean sprouts, and scallions to the hot broth one by one, before finally adding the cooked rice noodles. This method ensures the freshness and texture of the ingredients while also providing customers with the fun of DIY dining.
