Fishing City is an ancient city with a long history and also a marvel in the military history of both China and the world. Located on the banks of the Jialing River in Hechuan District, Chongqing, it sits atop a small hill called Fishing Mountain.

This place became an important military stronghold due to its strategic location. During the Song-Mongol Wars at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, Fishing City held out for 36 years.

In 1259, Mongol Khan Möngke led his army south to attack the Song Dynasty and met fierce resistance at Fishing City, ultimately dying in this battle. However, after the final fall of the Southern Song Dynasty, the city eventually chose to surrender, and the commanders who defended the city chose to commit suicide in allegiance to their country after the surrender.
