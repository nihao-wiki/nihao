# Explore White Emperor City and the Three Gorges

## White Emperor City

White Emperor City was an ancient military stronghold and is also a renowned scenic tourist area and source of literary inspiration. Famous poets such as Li Bai and Du Fu left behind memorable poems here. In 223 AD, after his defeat in the Battle of Yiling (also known as the Battle of Xiaoting), the Shu Han emperor Liu Bei retreated to it. While gravely ill there, he entrusted the state affairs and his son Liu Shan to Prime Minister Zhuge Liang, an event known as the "Entrustment at White Emperor City."

## The Three Gorges

The Three Gorges refers to the Qutang Gorge, Wu Gorge, and Xiling Gorge formed by the Yangtze River as it flows through central China. These three gorges are renowned for their rugged terrain and spectacular scenery.
