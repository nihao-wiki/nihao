## Night View from Above

Chongqing's night views are incredibly famous. Should you happen to arrive in Chongqing at night, opting for a window seat on **the left side** of the aircraft gives you <u>a 50% chance (determined by wind direction) to witness the beautiful urban night scenery of Chongqing</u> just before the plane lands.

> <font size="2">The runway numbers at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport are 02/20. Runway 02 is used for landings and takeoffs on a heading of north-east. The approach path for this runway happens to pass over the most beautifully lit urban area of Chongqing, presenting a stunning night view. Whether Runway 02 or Runway 20 is used for actual landings depends on the wind direction. Planes typically land into the wind, so when there is a southwest wind, there's a high probability that planes will be landing on Runway 02.</font>

If you're fortunate enough, as the plane clears the final mountain and makes its last right-hand maneuver, you'll catch sight of the Chongqing urban area, with only a few minutes remaining until touchdown.
