#### Garlic Chili Oil Dip

The classic dipping sauce in Chongqing hotpot culture, which includes **sesame oil** and **garlic**, can be referred to as "<Speech>香油蒜泥油碟</Speech>(Garlic Chili Oil Dip)". It plays several key roles, notably in:

- **Cooling Down**: It helps to reduce the surface temperature of the hotpot ingredients.
- **Mitigating Spiciness**: It can temper the spiciness of the food, allowing even those sensitive to heat to better enjoy their hotpot experience.
- **Enhancing Flavor**: It adds an extra layer of flavor to the hotpot ingredients.
- **Protect Gastrointestinal**: It helps reduce negative effects linked to eating spicy foods.

::: info Local Tips
As the hotpot gets spicier with each serving, you can add '<Speech>陈醋</Speech>(aged vinegar)' to your oil dip at opportune moments to further ease the spiciness.
:::

#### Vegetable Oil Dip

The hidden specialty oil dip, typically not readily available and only obtainable by asking a server. Similar to the garlic sesame oil dip, but made with vegetable oil instead. It has a distinctive flavor. Unlike some dips, it does not mitigate spiciness and can be extremely hot when consumed.

#### Dry Chili Dip

The dry version, known as "<Speech as="甘油碟">干油碟</Speech>(dry oil dip)", primarily consists of **chili powder**, **crushed peanuts**, **sesame seeds**, and other dry seasonings.
