# Must-Try: Chongqing's Home Cooking: Sichuan Cuisine

Chongqing's home-style cuisine has close ties with Sichuan cuisine, but it has also developed its own unique style and characteristics. Historically, Chongqing cuisine is a branch of Sichuan cuisine, but over time, it has gradually formed its own set of culinary philosophies and flavor profiles.

Douhua rice is beloved by locals for its affordability and simplicity. Douhua, rice, and braised pork (shaobai) are the classic combination of douhua rice. The white douhua is fresh, tender, and satisfying, while the red oil dipping sauce and green sticky rice dipping sauce give it its essence. A mouthful of douhua with a bowl of rice is especially appetizing. Paired with a bowl of braised pork, it becomes exquisite. With just these two items, locals can easily go through several bowls of rice.

Fish-Flavored Shredded Pork

Fish-Flavored Shredded Pork is a classic Sichuan dish. This dish came into being during the Second World War. Its characteristic "fish-like" flavor is created using seasonings that do not include fish, making it unique. The finished dish has a lustrous red color, an aromatic nose, and when eaten, it offers a harmonious blend of salty, fragrant, sour, and spicy flavors. The pork shreds are tender and smooth.

In the Chongqing region, it is made without bamboo shoots or wood ear mushrooms; instead, it uses diced scallions as the garnish. Prepared this way, the dish is particularly delicious when mixed with rice.

## Kung Pao Chicken
