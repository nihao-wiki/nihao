<Chinese word="麻辣">
<template #pinyin>má là</template>
</Chinese>

Chongqing cuisine can itself be seen as a subcategory of Sichuan cuisine, particularly known as Chongqing Jianghu cuisine.

It's known for its bold and spicy flavors, reflecting the culinary traditions of the local "jianghu" or "river and lake" culture.

Heavy use of oil, salt, chili, Sichuan pepper, and MSG are characteristics of Jianghu cuisine, with the liberal use of Sichuan pepper being particularly distinctive. People are often struck by the generous amount of chili used, but typically, Jianghu cuisine uses even more Sichuan pepper than chili. After dining on Jianghu cuisine, locals often break out in a sweat and experience a numbing sensation in their mouths, but they enjoy this refreshing feeling, akin to the carefree demeanor of wandering heroes in the Jianghu.

## Chicken Cuisine

### Spicy Chili Chicken

Spicy Chili Chicken is entirely red in color, with red chilies making up the main content. The chicken pieces are usually cut smaller than the chili peppers and stir-fried until quite dry, which helps them absorb the flavors better. Dryness and fragrance are hallmarks of this dish. Searching for the chicken amidst the chilies is part of the fun for locals; chatting while picking through the dish for chicken pieces is where the joy lies, and a bottle of beer completes the experience.

### Sliced Green Pepper Chicken

Sliced Green Pepper Chicken primarily uses pointed peppers and green Sichuan peppercorns, thus it is more numbing and presents a bright green color overall. The chicken is also cut into small, bite-sized pieces that are quite chewy. More oil is used in the cooking process, and over time, the spiciness and numbing flavors infuse into the oil, making the taste more intense. Local daredevils might even mix the oil and peppers with noodles, which would be extremely spicy.

There is also a dish called "Sliced Green Pepper Rabbit," which differs by using rabbit meat, giving it a more tender and springy texture. It is equally memorable.
