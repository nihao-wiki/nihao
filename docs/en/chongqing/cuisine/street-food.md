### Soy Milk and Fried Dough Sticks

Soy milk is a beverage made from soybeans that can be prepared in both sweet and savory versions. When paired with deep-fried dough sticks for breakfast, there has been significant debate across different regions of China about whether to choose sweet or savory soy milk. However, in Chongqing, sweet soy milk is preferred. 

deep-fried dough sticks is often dipped into the soy milk, which softens the dough stick and allows it to absorb some of the soy milk's flavor. This creates a unique eating experience where the youtiao becomes a vehicle for the soy milk.

### Fried Glutinous Rice Cakes

Rice cake pieces are typically shaped into flat forms and then deep-fried in hot oil until golden brown. The exterior is crispy, while the interior remains soft and glutinous, offering a unique contrast in texture. The fried rice cake pieces retain the characteristic stickiness of glutinous rice. In Chongqing, rice cake pieces often contain Sichuan pepper, giving them a distinctive flavor.

### Fried Glutinous Rice Cakes

The outer layer of the glutinous rice ball is coated with a thick layer of yellow bean powder, emitting a rich bean aroma. The inner layer is made of glutinous rice, which has a soft and glutinous texture with good stickiness and elasticity. When you bite into it, you can feel the distinctive chewy texture of the glutinous rice. It usually contains one or several segments of deep-fried dough sticks (youtiao), which have a crispy outer skin and a fluffy interior, forming a striking contrast to the softness of the glutinous rice. The addition of the dough sticks enriches the layers of texture in the entire glutinous rice ball.

### Oily Tea

Despite having "tea" in its name, it is not actually a tea beverage but rather a porridge-like dish based on rice flour. It is made from a rice flour paste and saozi. Saozi is a type of fried noodle that is typically cut into small pieces and added to the youtea.
