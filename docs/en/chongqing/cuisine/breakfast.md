Rice cake pieces are typically shaped into flat forms and then deep-fried in hot oil until golden brown.

The outer layer of the glutinous rice ball is coated with a thick layer of yellow bean powder, emitting a rich bean aroma. The inner layer is made of glutinous rice, which has a soft and glutinous texture with good stickiness and elasticity. When you bite into it, you can feel the distinctive chewy texture of the glutinous rice. It usually contains one or several segments of deep-fried dough sticks (youtiao), which have a crispy outer skin and a fluffy interior, forming a striking contrast to the softness of the glutinous rice. The addition of the dough sticks enriches the layers of texture in the entire glutinous rice ball.
