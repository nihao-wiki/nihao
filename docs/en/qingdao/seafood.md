# China Qingdao Seafood: Flavors from the Yellow Sea

Qingdao, as a coastal city, boasts a rich variety of seafood resources that are closely tied to the natural environment.

**Spring (March to May)**
- **Mackerel**: Spring is when mackerel is at its most delicious, with excellent meat quality, making it one of the main seafoods during this season.
- **Prawns**: Starting from spring, especially after the Qingming Festival, prawns become widely available.

**Autumn (September to November)**
- **Crabs**: Particularly around mid-August, crabs are at their most plump and tasty, making it the best time to enjoy them.

::: info LOCAL TIPS
During summer, due to the fishing moratorium implemented in the Qingdao sea area, the supply of freshly caught seafood may decrease for part of the season.
