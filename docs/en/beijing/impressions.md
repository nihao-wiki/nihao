## Features

Beijing, as the capital of China, is not only the political center but also a city with a rich cultural history dating back thousands of years. The history of human habitation in this area can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Zhou Dynasty. During the Liao and Jin Dynasties, Beijing gradually became a political center in the north, and it officially became the capital of the nation during the Yuan Dynasty, known then as Dadu. In the Ming Dynasty, after the Yongle Emperor moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, the city began its enduring role as the permanent capital.

- **Historical Capital**: The history of Beijing as the capital began in the Yuan Dynasty when Kublai Khan chose this location to establish Dadu, marking the beginning of Beijing's status as the national political center. In the early Ming Dynasty, there was a brief period where both Nanjing (the Southern Capital) and Beijing (the Northern Capital) coexisted, but after the formal relocation during the Yongle era, Beijing's position was solidified. This tradition continued through the Qing Dynasty until the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which ended the imperial era.
- **The Forbidden City**: The Forbidden City, now known as the Palace Museum, served as the imperial palace for the Ming and Qing Dynasties and is located in the heart of Beijing. Its construction began during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty and has stood for over 500 years. It is not only an exemplar of ancient palace architecture but also the largest and best-preserved group of wooden structures in the world today. The Forbidden City is renowned for its grand architectural complex, exquisite decorative art, and rich historical and cultural heritage.
- **The Great Wall**: Speaking of Beijing’s history, one cannot overlook the Great Wall. Although the Great Wall did not originate in Beijing, some of its most famous sections are found here, especially the Badaling section, which has become a symbol of the Chinese nation's perseverance. The construction of the Great Wall dates back to the Warring States Period, and after the unification of the six states, Emperor Qin Shi Huang connected the walls built by different states and expanded them to defend against northern nomadic tribes. During the Ming Dynasty, extensive repairs and expansions were carried out on the Great Wall to protect against Mongol invasions, forming the scale we see today.
